# üïµÔ∏è Masterminds Challenge - Network Forensics Investigation

## üìã Scenario Overview
Three machines in the Finance department at Pfeffer PLC were compromised. We suspect the initial source of the compromise happened through a phishing attempt and by an infected USB drive. The Incident Response team managed to pull the network traffic logs from the endpoints. Use Brim to investigate the network traffic for any indicators of an attack and determine who stands behind the attacks.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE**: DO NOT directly interact with any domains and IP addresses in this challenge.

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Deploy the machine attached to this task; it will be visible in the split-screen view once it is ready.

If you don't see a virtual machine load then click the Show Split View button.

## üéØ Investigation Objectives
Start by loading the Infection1 packet capture in Brim to investigate the compromise event for the first machine. All the PCAPs can be found here: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/PCAPs`

üìù **Note**: For questions that require multiple answers, please separate the answers with a comma.
