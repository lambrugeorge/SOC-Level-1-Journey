## 🧩 Hash Values: The Basics

> **Hash Value:**  
> A numeric value of fixed length that uniquely identifies data, generated by a hashing algorithm.

### Common Hashing Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Security Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **MD5**   | 128-bit hash, defined by RFC 1321, designed by Ron Rivest (1992). | ❌ Not secure (collisions possible) |
| **SHA-1** | 160-bit hash, defined by RFC 3174, invented by NSA (1995). | ❌ Deprecated (brute-force attacks) |
| **SHA-2** | Multiple variants (e.g., SHA-256), designed by NIST & NSA (2001). | ✅ Secure (recommended) |

> **Note:**  
> A hash is **not secure** if two files can have the same hash (collision).

## 🦠 Hashes in Malware Analysis

Security professionals use hash values to:

- Identify malware samples
- Reference suspicious files
- Share IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)

You’ll often see hashes in ransomware reports (e.g., [The DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/), [Trellix Threat Research Blogs](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs.html)).

## ⚡ How Easy Is It to Change a Hash?

Even a single bit change in a file creates a new hash!  
**Example:**

```powershell
# Before modification
Get-FileHash .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi -Algorithm MD5
# Output: D1A008E3A606F24590A02B853E955CF7

# Modify the file
echo "AppendTheHash" >> .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi

# After modification
Get-FileHash .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi -Algorithm MD5
# Output: 9D52B46F5DE41B73418F8E0DACEC5E9F

## 🌐 IP Addresses in the Pyramid of Pain

An **IP address** identifies any device on a network (PCs, servers, cameras, etc.).

- In the Pyramid of Pain, IP addresses are marked **green** 🟩.
- Blocking malicious IPs is a common defense, but attackers can easily switch IPs.

### Example: Malicious IP Connections

# 🛡️ Fast Flux: Techniques for Cyber Resilience and Evasion

> ⚠️ **NOTE!** Do not interact with the IP addresses shown above.

## 📌 What is Fast Flux?

Fast Flux is a DNS technique used by **botnets** to hide malicious activities such as:
- 🧪 malware delivery
- 🕵️ phishing
- 🌐 malicious web proxies
- 🧬 communication with command and control (C&C) servers

🎯 **Goal:** To make it harder for security analysts to detect and block malicious infrastructure.

---

## 🔄 How Does Fast Flux Work?

- Associates **multiple IP addresses** with a single domain name that **constantly changes**.
- The botnet uses **compromised hosts** as proxies to relay traffic to the real servers.
- IPs are **rapidly rotated** via DNS, making takedowns and denylisting extremely difficult.

📚 Example: Palo Alto Networks explains this well in their fictional scenario:  
**"Fast Flux 101: How Cybercriminals Improve the Resilience of Their Infrastructure"**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Fast Flux helps attackers:
- 🔐 protect their malicious infrastructure
- ⏫ maintain uptime of illegal operations
- 💸 avoid revenue loss from phishing, scams, botnet rentals, and gambling sites

🆚 While similar to legal practices like RRDNS or CDNs, the **purpose is malicious**.

🔁 Rapid IP rotation via DNS → makes takedowns and denylisting harder

---

## 🧠 Advanced Techniques

### 1️⃣ Single Fast Flux  
- Only the frontend IP addresses change frequently.

### 2️⃣ Double Flux  
- 🔀 DNS resolution (NS records) is also part of the fast flux network → even harder to eliminate.

### 3️⃣ DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms)  
- 🧮 Automatically generates new domain names daily/periodically → nearly impossible to block without the algorithm.

## 🟦 Domain Names: Next Level in the Pyramid of Pain

Let's climb higher on the Pyramid of Pain and talk about **Domain Names**! Notice how the color shifts from green (IP addresses) to teal, showing increased difficulty for attackers.

---

### 🌐 What is a Domain Name?

A **domain name** maps an IP address to a human-readable string (like `evilcorp.com`).  
- **Format:**  
       - Domain + Top-Level Domain: `evilcorp.com`
       - Subdomain + Domain + TLD: `tryhackme.evilcorp.com`

We won't dive deep into DNS here, but if you're curious, check out the ["DNS in Detail" Room](#).

![image](domain-name.png)

---

### 🛡️ Why Are Domains Harder to Change?

Attackers need to:
- Purchase/register a domain
- Set up DNS records

But, many DNS providers have loose standards and APIs, making it easier for attackers to swap domains quickly.

---

### 🚩 Malicious Domains in Action

**Example:** Sodinokibi C2 (Command & Control) domains

![image](domain-name2.png)

Can you spot anything suspicious? Compare it to a legitimate website below.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Punycode Attacks

Attackers use **Punycode** to create domains that look legitimate but are malicious.

> **What is Punycode?**  
> "Punycode is a way of converting words that cannot be written in ASCII, into a Unicode ASCII encoding." — *Jamf*

**Example:**  
- Looks like: `adıdas.de`  
- Real Punycode: `http://xn--addas-o4a.de/`

Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.) now display the true Punycode to help users spot fakes.

---

### 🔎 Detecting Malicious Domains

- Analyze **proxy logs** or **web server logs** for suspicious domains.
- Attackers often use **URL shorteners** to hide malicious links.

**Common URL Shorteners:**
- `bit.ly`
- `goo.gl`
- `ow.ly`
- `s.id`
- `smarturl.it`
- `tiny.pl`
- `tinyurl.com`
- `x.co`

> **Tip:**  
> Add a `+` at the end of a shortened URL (e.g., `tinyurl.com/example+`) to preview the destination.

*Note: The examples above are non-existent and safe.*

---

### 🧪 Analyzing Connections in Any.run

**Any.run** is a sandbox that detonates malware samples and shows their network activity.

#### 🕸️ Tabs to Explore:
- **HTTP Requests:** See what files/resources are fetched (e.g., droppers, callbacks).
- **Connections:** View all communications (e.g., C2 traffic, FTP uploads).
- **DNS Requests:** Check which domains the malware tries to resolve.

> ⚠️ **Caution:**  
> Never visit IPs or URLs from malware reports—they are likely dangerous!

---

### 📝 Quick Quiz

1. **First suspicious domain in the Any.run report:**  
        `craftingalegacy.com`

2. **What term refers to an address used to access websites?**  
        🏷️ **Domain Name**

3. **What type of attack uses Unicode characters in the domain name to imitate a known domain?**  
        🕵️ **Punycode attack**

4. **Preview the redirected website for:**  
        `https://tinyurl.com/bw7t8p4u+`  
        ➡️ `https://tryhackme.com/`

## 🟨 Host Artifacts: Climbing Higher on the Pyramid

Let's take another step up to the **yellow zone** of the Pyramid of Pain.

At this level, defenders focus on **host artifacts**—the traces attackers leave on compromised systems. Detecting these artifacts forces attackers to change their tools and techniques, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive for them.

![image](host-artefacts.png)

### 🖥️ What Are Host Artifacts?

Host artifacts include:
- Registry changes
- Suspicious process executions
- Unique attack patterns or IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Files dropped or modified by malware
- Any evidence specific to the current threat

#### Examples:

- **Suspicious process execution from Word:**  
        Attackers may use Microsoft Word to launch malicious processes.

- **Events after opening a malicious application:**  
        Unusual system events or new processes may appear.

- **Files dropped by malware:**  
        Malicious executables or scripts are often left behind.

## 📝 Knowledge Check

A security vendor analyzed a malicious sample. Here’s what I learned from reviewing the report:

1. **A process named `regidle.exe` makes a POST request to an IP address in the US on port 8080. What is the IP address?**  
         **Answer:** `96.126.101.6`

2. **The actor drops a malicious executable (EXE). What is the name of this executable?**  
         **Answer:** `G_jugk.exe`

3. **According to the VirusTotal report, how many vendors determine this host to be malicious?**  
         *(Check the report for the exact number.)*

## 🟨 Network Artifacts: Deepening Detection in the Yellow Zone

Network artifacts are also part of the **yellow zone** in the Pyramid of Pain. Detecting these artifacts means attackers must invest more effort to change their tactics or tools, giving defenders a valuable time advantage for response and remediation.

![image](network-artifacts.png)

### 🌐 What Are Network Artifacts?

A **network artifact** can include:
- User-Agent strings
- Command and Control (C2) information
- URI patterns in HTTP requests

For example, attackers may use a **User-Agent** string that is unusual or never seen before in your environment. According to [RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616), the User-Agent header identifies the client software making the request.

### 🕵️ Detecting Network Artifacts

Network artifacts can be found by:
- Analyzing **PCAP files** (packet captures) in tools like **Wireshark** or **TShark**
- Reviewing **IDS logs** from systems like **Snort**

#### Example: Filtering User-Agent Strings with TShark

```sh
tshark --Y http.request -T fields -e http.host -e http.user_agent -r analysis_file.pcap
```

This command extracts HTTP host and User-Agent fields from a PCAP file.

### 🦠 Emotet Downloader Trojan: User-Agent Patterns

Certain malware, like the **Emotet Downloader Trojan**, often uses distinctive User-Agent strings. Detecting these custom strings can help you block malicious traffic and disrupt attacker operations.

> **Tip:** Monitoring for rare or suspicious User-Agent strings can reveal attacker activity and provide opportunities for proactive defense.

---

## 📝 Knowledge Check

1. **What browser uses the User-Agent string shown in the screenshot above?**  
        *(Refer to the screenshot for the answer.)*
