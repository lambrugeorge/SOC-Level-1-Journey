# Introduction to MITRE in Cybersecurity 🚀

If you're new to cybersecurity, you might not have heard of **MITRE**. Many seasoned professionals associate MITRE primarily with the [CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)](https://cve.mitre.org/) list—a go-to resource for researching vulnerabilities and exploits. However, MITRE's impact extends far beyond CVEs. As a US-based non-profit, MITRE conducts research across diverse fields such as artificial intelligence 🤖, health informatics 🏥, and space security 🛰️, all with the mission to enhance the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.

> **From [mitre.org](https://www.mitre.org/):**  
> “At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.”

## Key MITRE Cybersecurity Projects 🔐

In this guide, we'll focus on several MITRE initiatives that are essential for cybersecurity professionals:

- **ATT&CK®** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework 🛡️  
       A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

- **CAR** (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base 📊  
       A collection of analytics to detect adversary behaviors in network and endpoint data.

- **ENGAGE** 🤝  
       A framework for planning and executing adversary engagement operations (not an acronym, but a powerful tool!).

- **D3FEND** (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense) 🧩  
       A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures mapped to ATT&CK techniques.

- **AEP** (ATT&CK Emulation Plans) 📝  
       Structured plans to emulate adversary behaviors for testing and improving defenses.
