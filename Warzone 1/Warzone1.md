## Quick Notes & Lessons Learned üìù

- Alert signatures (IDS/ET rules) give a fast initial triage cue ‚Äî confirm with traffic analysis.  
- Use VirusTotal Community tab to correlate IPs/domains to threat actors and file types.  
- Inspect HTTP headers (User-Agent, Host, Server) for suspicious or uncommon clients.  
- Extract downloaded files/paths from HTTP/FTP artifacts to build host remediation steps.  
- Multiple IPs/domains often indicate distributed infrastructure ‚Äî track all of them and check TLS/SSL certs where available.
