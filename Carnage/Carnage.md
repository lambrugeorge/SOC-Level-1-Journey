## Scenario üß©

Eric Fischer from the Purchasing Department at Bartell Ltd received an email from a known contact with a Word document attachment. Upon opening the document, he accidentally clicked on **"Enable Content"**. The SOC Department immediately received an alert from the endpoint agent that Eric's workstation was making suspicious outbound connections. The pcap was retrieved from the network sensor and handed to you for analysis.

**Task:** Investigate the packet capture and uncover the malicious activities.  

*Credit goes to Brad Duncan for capturing the traffic and sharing the pcap packet capture with the InfoSec community.*

üí° **Lessons Learned from Post-Infection Analysis:**

- Monitoring **C2 domains** helps track malware post-infection behavior.  
- Observing **packet headers** (like Server headers) can reveal the technology stack of the malicious servers.  
- DNS queries for external IPs (via API) indicate malware attempting to detect network environment.  
- SMTP traffic analysis can uncover malspam campaigns and infrastructure.  
- Characterizing the **first bytes** sent to C2 servers can help create network signatures for detection.
