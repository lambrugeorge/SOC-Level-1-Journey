# Snort

## 🚀 What is Snort?
Snort is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS) developed by Martin Roesch and maintained by Cisco Talos. It analyzes live and captured network traffic using rules to detect malicious activity and generate alerts.

## 🖥️ Lab Setup & Navigation
- All exercises are in the **Task-Exercises** folder on the Desktop.
- Two subfolders:
  - **Config-Sample:** Example config and rule files (for practice, not used by Snort directly)
  - **Exercise-Files:** Folders for each task, with pcap, log, and rule files ready to use

---

## ⚡ Traffic Generator
- The VM is offline, but you can generate traffic using `traffic-generator.sh`.
- Run it with `sudo ./traffic-generator.sh`.
- Choose the exercise type and watch the output in a new terminal window.
- Each traffic type is designed for a specific exercise—make sure Snort is running before starting!
