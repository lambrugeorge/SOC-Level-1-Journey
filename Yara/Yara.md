## üßê What is Yara?

> "The pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers (and everyone else)"  
> ‚Äî Virustotal, 2020

Yara helps you identify information in files using both binary and textual patterns (like hexadecimal values and strings).  
**Yara rules** are used to label these patterns‚Äîoften to detect if a file is malicious based on its features.

### üí° Example: Strings in Malware

Just like in programming, malware uses strings to store data. Here are some examples:

| Type        | Data                                 | Description                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ransomware  | `12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw` | Bitcoin Wallet for ransom payments          |
| Botnet      | `12.34.56.7`                         | IP address of the Command and Control (C&C) |

---

## ‚ùì Quick Questions

- **What is the name of the base-16 numbering system that Yara can detect?**  
        `hexadecimal` ‚úÖ

- **Would the text "Enter your Name" be a string in an application?**  
        `Yay` ‚úÖ

# üõ†Ô∏è Your First Yara Rule

![image](yara.png)

Yara uses its own simple rule language. Every Yara command needs:

1. The rule file you create
2. The file, directory, or process ID to scan

**Example:**  
To use `myrule.yar` on a directory called `somedirectory`:
```bash
yara myrule.yar somedirectory
```
`.yar` is the standard extension for Yara rules.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Let's Create a Basic Rule

1. Create a file:
    ```bash
    touch somefile
    ```
2. Create your first rule file:
    ```bash
    touch myfirstrule.yar
    ```
3. Edit `myfirstrule.yar` and add:
    ```yara
    rule examplerule {
         condition: true
    }
    ```

This rule checks if the file exists. If it does, Yara outputs the rule name.

**Run it:**
```bash
yara myfirstrule.yar somefile
```
If the file exists, you'll see:
```
examplerule somefile
```
If not, you'll get an error.

# üîç Yara Rule Anatomy

Yara rules have several sections:

| Keyword   | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| meta      | Descriptive info (doesn't affect the rule logic) |
| strings   | Patterns to search for (text or hex)             |
| condition | The logic that triggers a match                  |

### üìù Example: Searching for Strings

```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
         $hello_world = "Hello World!"
    condition:
         $hello_world
}
```
This matches any file containing "Hello World!".

#### üîÑ Case Variations

To match different cases:
```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
         $hello_world = "Hello World!"
         $hello_world_lowercase = "hello world"
         $hello_world_uppercase = "HELLO WORLD"
    condition:
         any of them
}
```
Now, any of those strings will trigger the rule.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Conditions

You can use operators like `<=`, `>=`, `!=` and combine conditions with `and`, `or`, `not`.

**Example:**
```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
         $hello_world = "Hello World!"
    condition:
         #hello_world <= 10
}
```
This matches if "Hello World!" appears 10 times or less.

**Combining Conditions:**
```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
    strings:
         $hello_world = "Hello World!"
    condition:
         $hello_world and filesize < 10KB
}
```
This matches only if the file contains "Hello World!" **and** is smaller than 10KB.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Real-World Yara Usage

Let's see how Yara rules work in practice!  
When you run a rule like the one above, Yara will output the rule name and the file name if there's a match.

```
cmnatic@thm:~$ yara myfirstrule.yar mytextfile.txt
helloworld_textfile_checker mytextfile.txt
```

- The text in the red box is the rule name.
- The text in the green box is the matched file.

## üß† Key lesson
![image](6.png)
- **Yara rules help you find exactly what makes a file suspicious.**  
- The string variable that triggers a match is crucial for understanding why a file was flagged.  
- Automation tools like yarGen make this process faster and

## üîé What did I find?

- I used Valhalla to check the SHA256 hash of file 1.  
- Valhalla showed that this file is already known in the threat intelligence community. üìä  
- This means my detection was correct and the file is not just suspicious, but actually linked to real-world threats. ‚úÖ  
- Using platforms like Valhalla helps confirm if a file is part of a known malware campaign or APT activity. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîó

Valhalla

Valhalla is an online Yara feed created and hosted by Nextron-Systems (Florian Roth). It provides thousands of high-quality Yara rules to boost your detection capabilities. üöÄ

You can search Valhalla using keywords, tags, ATT&CK techniques, SHA256 hashes, or rule names. This makes it a valuable resource for threat intelligence and malware research. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### üìù What did I do and learn?

- I checked the SHA256 hash of file 1 in Valhalla and confirmed it is attributed to an APT group. üéØ
- For file 2, the first Yara rule to detect it is `Webshell_b374k_rule1`.
- On VirusTotal, the Yara signature match for file 2 comes from the **THOR APT Scanner**. ![image](7.png)
- Not every antivirus detected file 2 as malicious on VirusTotal, showing the importance of using multiple tools. ‚ùó
- File 2 was also found with the `.EXE` extension, not just `.PHP`.
- The JavaScript library used by file 2 is **Zepto**. ![image](8.png)
- The Yara rule for this hack tool is not in the default Loki ruleset, but it is present in the commercial THOR scanner.
