# Cyber Kill Chain üöÄ

![Cyber Kill Chain Diagram](1.png)

The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a concept adapted from military strategy, describing the stages of a cyber attack. Developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011, this framework helps cybersecurity professionals understand and defend against threats by breaking down an attack into distinct phases.

Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain is crucial for anyone in cybersecurity, including SOC Analysts, Security Researchers, Threat Hunters, and Incident Responders. By recognizing each phase, you can spot intrusion attempts early and disrupt the attack before it causes damage. üõ°Ô∏è

## Why Learn the Cyber Kill Chain? ü§î

- **Identify Security Gaps:** Assess your network and systems to find and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Defend Against Attacks:** Protect against ransomware, data breaches, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- **Understand Adversaries:** Learn how attackers think and operate to better defend your organization.

## The 7 Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain

1. **Reconnaissance**
2. **Weaponization**
3. **Delivery**
4. **Exploitation**
5. **Installation**
6. **Command & Control**
7. **Actions on Objectives**

In this room, you'll learn about each phase, the pros and cons of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain, and how to break the chain to stop attackers in their tracks. üõë

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance üîç

To defend against attacks, it's important to understand how attackers gather information. **Reconnaissance** is the planning phase, where adversaries collect data about their target.

### What is OSINT? üåê

**OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** is a key part of reconnaissance. Attackers use publicly available information‚Äîlike company size, employee emails, and phone numbers‚Äîto identify potential targets.

### Attacker's Perspective

Imagine an attacker named "Megatron" planning a sophisticated attack. His first step is reconnaissance, using OSINT to gather as much information as possible.

#### Example: Email Harvesting üìß

Email harvesting involves collecting email addresses from public sources. Attackers use these for phishing‚Äîtricking victims into revealing sensitive information.

**Popular Reconnaissance Tools:**
- `theHarvester`: Gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs from public sources.
- `Hunter.io`: Finds contact information linked to a domain.
- `OSINT Framework`: A collection of OSINT tools organized by category.

Attackers also use social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to gather information about companies and individuals. This data can be used to craft convincing phishing attacks. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Learning Outcome:**  
By the end of this room, you'll be able to recognize each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain and know how to disrupt an attack before it succeeds. Let's continue exploring the next phases! üö¶
