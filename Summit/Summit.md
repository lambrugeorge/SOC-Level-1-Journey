# TryHackMe Summit Room üèîÔ∏è

## Challenge Overview

In this premium TryHackMe room, I participated in a **threat simulation and detection engineering challenge** based on the Pyramid of Pain. The goal was to chase a simulated adversary up the pyramid by detecting and blocking their malware samples, increasing the cost of their operations until they gave up.

### Scenario

![image](1.png)

PicoSecure, after several incident response activities, decided to run a threat simulation. I worked alongside an external penetration tester in a purple-team scenario. The tester tried to execute malware samples on a simulated internal workstation, while I had to configure security tools to detect and prevent the malware from running.

The challenge followed the **Pyramid of Pain**‚Äîeach level required me to detect and block different indicators of attack, starting from the easiest (hashes) and moving up to more complex indicators.

## Task 1: Detecting sample1.exe

- **File:** sample1.exe  
- **Tags:** Trojan.Metasploit.A  
- **MD5:** cbda8ae000aa9cbe7c8b982bae006c2a  
- **SHA256:** 9c550591a25c6228cb7d74d970d133d75c961ffed2ef7180144859cc09efca8c  
- **Behavior:** Detected as malicious (Metasploit), connects to unusual port, reads machine GUID, checks LSA protection, etc.

After configuring the detection tools to block this sample by its hash, I received the first flag:

**Flag 1:**  
`THM{f3cbf08151a11a6a331db9c6cf5f4fe4}`

## Task 2: Detecting sample2.exe

- **File:** sample2.exe  
- **Tags:** Trojan.Metasploit.A  
- **MD5:** 4d661bf605d6b0b15915a533b572a6bd  
- **SHA256:** d576245e85e6b752b2fdffa43abaab1b2e1383556b0169fd04924d6cebc1cdf9  
- **Behavior:** Also detected as malicious, but with a new hash. Connects to unusual IP and port, reads machine GUID, checks LSA protection, etc.
- **Network Activity:**  
  - HTTP GET to `http://154.35.10.113:4444/uvLk8YI32`
  - TCP connections to `154.35.10.113:4444` and Microsoft IPs

The adversary simply recompiled the malware to bypass hash-based detection, demonstrating the weakness of relying solely on hashes. I needed to use a new detection method for this sample.

## Key Takeaways üìù

- **Hash-based detection** is high-confidence but easy to bypass with minor changes to the file.
- **Adversaries adapt quickly**‚Äîdetection strategies must evolve beyond simple indicators like hashes.
- The Pyramid of Pain framework helps structure detection efforts, pushing defenders to use more resilient and costly-to-evade indicators.
